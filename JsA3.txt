Q1. Write the Code for all Data types.

Ans. This is a number
 let num = 12345;
        console.log(num);
    o/p:- 12345
    
 This is a String
    let str = "Software Developer"
      console.log(str);
  o/p:- Software Developer
    
  This is Boolean
   let x = 10;
        let y = 20;
        let result = x>y;
        let result1 = x<y;
        console.log(result);
        console.log(result1);
    o/p:- false
          true

    This is an array
      var x = ["java", "html", "css"];
        console.log(x);

    This is an Object
        var x = {Fisrt:"Narendra", last:"Modi"}

    This is null
        var x = null;
        console.log(x)
    o/p:- null

   This is an undefined 
    var x = ;
    console.log(x)
    o/p:- x is undefined

  This is example of bigint
    let z = 12344566777n

Q2. What are the uses of JavaScript Operators?
Ans. Operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.

Q3. Explain the Assignment Operator.
Ans. The assignment operator = assigns the value of its right-hand operand to a variable, a property, or an indexer element given by its left-hand operand.
=, +=, -=, *=, /+, %=, **

Q4. Explain the all Arithmetic Operators.
Ans. operator           Description

        +               Addition
        -               Subtraction
        *               Multiplication
        /               Division
        %               Modulus(Remainder)
        **              Exponentiation
        ++              Increment
        --              Decrement

Q5. What are the Binary Operators in js?
Ans. These operators require two operands for operation.

Q6. Explain the Pre-Increment and Post Increment in js.
In both cases, the variable num is incremented by 1. However, the pre-increment operator ++ increases the value before it is used, while the post-increment operator ++ increases the value after it is used.
